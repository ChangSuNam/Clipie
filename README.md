# Overview
When you have to copy and paste multiple texts, it is helpful to have a clipboard of items you copied recently. This project creates a browser extension for such clipboard. It will show the content of the copied / pasted text, with the time stamp with when it was copy or paste. It will display buttons that user can click to copy the texts that were copy or pasted in the past again.
In addition, it allows the user to download the .txt file of their clipboard history. The user can delete their data as well.
